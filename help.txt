1. Force Re-authentication (Quickest Fix) 
Google often remembers user consent and session information. The simplest way to bypass this cache and force the use of the new client is to add the prompt=consent parameter to your authorization request URL: 
Modify your login URL to include &prompt=consent (or ?prompt=consent if it's the first parameter).
This forces the user to re-select their Google account and grant permissions, which should in turn use the new client ID defined in your code.
Once this works, subsequent logins without the prompt=consent parameter should function correctly with the new client. 

2. Verify Your Application's Configuration
The most likely cause is that your application's code is still referencing the old client ID or client secret.
Check your source code/configuration files and ensure the new Client ID and new Client Secret are updated everywhere they are used.
If you downloaded a JSON file with credentials from the Google Cloud Console, make sure you've updated the file you're currently using in your application's backend or frontend. 

3. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies 
Your browser might have cached the old consent screen or session data. 
Clear your browser's cache and cookies, specifically those related to your application's domain and accounts.google.com.
Alternatively, try logging in using an incognito/private browsing window or a completely different browser that has no prior session data for your application. 

4. Check Authorized Redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console 
Ensure that the Authorized Redirect URIs configured in the Google Cloud Console for your new OAuth client match exactly what your application is sending in the authentication request. A mismatch will cause an error or unexpected behavior. 
Go to APIs & Services > Credentials in the Google Cloud Console.
Click on your new OAuth 2.0 client ID.
Verify that the redirect URIs listed are correct and complete (including http:// or https:// and any specific paths). 

5. Verify the Login Flow is Initiated Correctly
Double-check the URL your application generates to start the Google login process. It should explicitly contain the new client_id as a query parameter. 
If you are using a third-party library or framework for OAuth (like Passport.js, Firebase, etc.), ensure that you've updated the configuration within that library's settings to use the new credentials.
